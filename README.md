This is a voice activated A.I. news app that will pull news headlines from a source you specify, read those headlines if you want, and then open the news story of your choosing.  I used the Alan AI interface for the voice recognition (alan.app).  The news sources are pulled from newsapi.org.  Must have a microphone to be able to use the app.
